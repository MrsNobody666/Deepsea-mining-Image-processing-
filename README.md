# 🌊 Deep-Sea Mining Image Processing Pipeline

A complete end-to-end image processing pipeline focused on deep-sea mining imagery. This project demonstrates a range of classic image transformation techniques to extract and enhance visual data from the ocean floor.

---

## 🧠 Overview

Deep-sea mining presents complex visual challenges due to murky environments, low lighting, and organic interference. This project processes raw underwater images to improve clarity and extract meaningful features — enabling better scientific understanding and automation.

**Key Techniques Implemented:**

- 🎯 Image Segmentation  
- 🦴 Skeletonization  
- 🎭 Color Inversion  
- ⚫ Grayscale Conversion  
- ✨ Additional Enhancements & Filters

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.x  
- 📷 OpenCV (`cv2`)  
- 🔢 NumPy  
- 📊 Matplotlib (for visual debugging)
